Flashing this was a little different from other maps.

1. make the keymap (as normal)
2. `make daisy:mapname` (as normal)
3. move the hex file from WSL somewhere more easily accessible for Windows
4. download the Reflash tool from [this site](https://ydkb.io/)
5. select the keyboard and hex file in the tool, click Reflash
6. while plugging in the keyboard, hold Escape

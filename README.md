# Keyboards

Here are all my custom qmk firmwares.

Copy these into [`qmk_firmware`](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) (or [`germ/qmk_firmware`](https://github.com/germ/qmk_firmware) for the Georgi/Butterstick) to apply them.

Note to future self: The reason I didn't keep going with my own fork of qmk is because it's a bit too active to keep up with, and I don't need to PR them to include my personal keyboards.
